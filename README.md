Example PHP Keycloak authentication

To run this PHP file
1. Pull the git to the htdocs location at "C:\xampp\htdocs".
2. Use any browser then go to "http://localhost/example/login.php".
3. Experiment with usage.

Important notes from developer
1. The keycloak client configuration for this file is located at "http://devid.smsglobal.net/admin/master/console/#/master/clients/0bc9a1e3-c05a-4bba-9b42-d67bb4f3460c/settings".
2. All the written PHP codes that showcase Keycloak usage are only API calls with applied logic, hence this usecase scenario can be translated to other language such as typescript.
